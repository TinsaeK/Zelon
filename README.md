<h3> About The Project</h3>
This project initially was meant to be a game that offers the player a maze that they have to navigate through in dim lighting, while avoiding enemies with their own behavior trees. however i had to make changes and instead implemented a perlin noise background on the title screen. here is the video with the gameplay.
