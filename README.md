<h3> About The Project</h3>
This project was initially meant to be a game that offers the player a maze that they have to navigate through in dim lighting, while avoiding enemies with their own behavior trees. however i had to make changes and instead implemented a perlin noise background on the title screen. here is the video with the gameplay.

<h3> Components</h3>
There are various components to this game. The maze layout was manually done, here is what a zoomed out view of the whole maze looks like

 The Sprite for the character is the image above the title. The noise is generated using <a href="https://github.com/TinsaeK/Zelon/blob/main/perlin.gd">this code</a>.
